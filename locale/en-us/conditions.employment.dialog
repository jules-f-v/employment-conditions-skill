My conditions are in the clerks award. it would be a good idea if you read that. i suppose the key things for you to be aware of are that i'm a full time employee. so i work a maximum hours of 38 hours per week. i'm not interested in working more than that, so don't ask. i am employed at a level 1 classification under the clerks award. i can tell you the my rate of pay if you are too lazy to look it up yourself. just know that i check my pay every fortnight and if it is not right i will be letting you know! and do not forget to pay me my super. it is currently 9.5% but is hopefully going up to 10% on 1 july this year. i will be checking that too. i've also got leave entitlements, so dforget about those either.
